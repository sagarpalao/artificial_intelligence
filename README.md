# Artificial Intelligence
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Artificial Intelligence. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. A Star
2. Decision Tree
3. Hill Climbing
4. MiniMax
5. Some experiments in Prolog
6. Uniform Cost Search
7. WumpusWorldProblem
